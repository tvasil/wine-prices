Predict the rating of a wine given other characteristics

This project is inspired by the Kaggle Dataset [Wine Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews) by user [@zackthoutt](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide)

The aim of the project is to build a web application that would allow users to input characteristics about the wine they're drinking right now, and receive a rating estimate of the wine (what Wine Enthusiast would have rated it).
